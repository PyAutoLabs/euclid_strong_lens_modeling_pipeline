"""
Run-level check: a real fit actually **writes** the Euclid latent catalogue.

``tests/test_compute_latent_variable.py`` proves the latent *values* are right,
but it calls ``LatentEuclid.variables`` directly. That path is ungated, so it
would keep passing even if the pipeline never wrote a latent again. The write
is gated: ``autonerves.test_mode.skip_latents()`` is
``is_test_mode() or PYAUTO_SKIP_LATENTS``, consumed at exactly one line
(``PyAutoFit/autofit/non_linear/search/updater.py``'s
``_compute_latent_samples``), and there is **no override** — no environment
variable forces latents on under test mode. So the only way to prove the
pipeline still writes them is a fit with ``PYAUTO_TEST_MODE`` unset, which is
why this module is marked ``slow`` and runs in its own CI job: a failure here
means "the fit stopped emitting latents", which is a different problem from a
wrong latent value.

The file to assert on is ``files/latent/latent_summary.json``, **not**
``files/latent.csv``: this repository's ``config/output.yaml`` sets
``latent_draw_via_pdf: true``, and on that branch the updater calls only
``save_samples_summary(..., "latent/latent_summary")`` — ``save_latent_samples``
never runs, so no ``latent.csv`` is written.

Two things shape the fit:

* **``af.Drawer``, not a sampler.** It draws uniformly from the priors and does
  no parameter search — the cheapest real search in PyAutoFit — while still
  running the full post-fit updater path, so ``skip_latents()`` and
  ``latent_after_fit`` behave exactly as in production. (The pipeline scripts
  hard-code ``n_live=750`` for Nautilus with no override; that is not a CI fit.)
* **The model is anchored on the truth**, with a single free parameter
  (``einstein_radius``, uniform within 10 per cent of its true value). A Drawer
  over a fully free model draws junk: the source's linear intensity solves to
  exactly zero, ``magnification`` becomes ``0 / 0`` and lands in the summary as
  NaN — and a NaN latent is **dropped from ``latent_summary.json`` entirely**.
  That is worth knowing, and it is why the key-set assertion below is also the
  NaN check: a latent that failed to compute is a missing key, not a NaN value.

Wall time: about 15 s (10 likelihood evaluations plus 10 latent evaluations on
the 100x100 masked simulated VIS image, non-JAX).

The last test in the module is the odd one out: it **mutates** the pixelized
fit's output — it deletes ``files/wcs.json`` out of the search's zip and re-runs
that search under ``force_pickle_overwrite: true``, the upgrade path by which an
already-finished DR1 run gains a record it was fitted without. It must stay
last, because every test above reads the output the module fixture built.

    is how an already-finished DR1 run gets a record it was fitted without.

    ``AbstractSearch.result_via_completed_fit`` is the path under test: the fit
    is complete, so no likelihood is evaluated and no sample changes — the
    search reports "Fit Already Completed" and, on the flag, calls
    ``analysis.save_results`` again. So the identifier (and therefore the zip
    name) must be unchanged and the record must be back, decoded, with its
    clumps and the solver keys.

    The flag is flipped in a *second copy* of the config, never in the
    repository's ``config/general.yaml``, and the fixture's own copy is pushed
    back in a ``finally`` — the fixture's own ``finally`` then re-pushes the
    repository config for whatever module runs next. It has to be a second
    directory rather than an edit of the copy already pushed: ``Config.push``
    returns immediately when the path handed to it is already ``configs[0]``
